  abstract = {Many of the systems that appear in various signal processing applications are non-linear, for example, due to hardware impairments such as non-linear amplifiers and finite-resolution quantization. The Bussgang decomposition is a popular tool for analyzing the performance of systems that involve such non-linear components. In a nutshell, the decomposition provides an exact probabilistic relationship between the output and the input of a non-linearity: the output is equal to a scaled version of the input plus uncorrelated distortion. The decomposition can either be used to compute exact performance results or lower bounds where the uncorrelated distortion is treated as independent noise. This lecture note explains the basic theory, provides key examples, extends the theory to complex-valued vector signals, and clarifies some potential misconceptions.},

  abstract = {Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) can improve the overall system performance significantly. Massive MIMO systems, however, may require a large number of radio frequency (RF) chains that could cause high cost and power consumption issues. One of promising approaches to resolve these issues is using low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) at base stations. Channel estimation becomes a difficult task by using low-resolution ADCs though. This paper addresses the channel estimation problem for massive MIMO systems using one-bit ADCs when the channels are spatially and temporally correlated. Based on the Bussgang decomposition, which reformulates a non-linear one-bit quantization to a statistically equivalent linear operator, the Kalman filter is used to estimate the spatially and temporally correlated channel by assuming the quantized noise follows a Gaussian distribution. Numerical results show that the proposed technique can improve the channel estimation quality significantly by properly exploiting the spatial and temporal correlations of channels.},

  abstract = {Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is a key technology driving the 5G evolution. It relies on the use a large number of antennas at the base-station to improve network performance. The performance of massive MIMO systems is often limited by imperfect channel estimation because of pilot contamination. Recently, several channel estimation techniques have been proposed to minimize the performance degradation. However, the assessment of these techniques in the literature has often been conducted considering standard channel models, like the independent Rayleigh fading model and Clarke's multipath model, which do not consider spatial correlation. In this work, we investigate different channel models used and proposed for massive MIMO transmission and, through numerical studies, highlight their effect on the performance of the aforementioned channel estimation techniques. Based on this we recommend the use of channel models that capture the spatial correlation between antennas and different user channels.},

  abstract = {This paper considers channel estimation and system performance for the uplink of a single-cell massive multiple-input multiple-output system. Each receiver antenna of the base station is assumed to be equipped with a pair of one-bit analog-to-digital converters to quantize the real and imaginary part of the received signal. We first propose an approach for channel estimation that is applicable for both flat and frequency-selective fading, based on the Bussgang decomposition that reformulates the nonlinear quantizer as a linear function with identical first- and second-order statistics. The resulting channel estimator outperforms previously proposed approaches across all SNRs. We then derive closed-form expressions for the achievable rate in flat fading channels assuming low SNR and a large number of users for the maximal ratio and zero forcing receivers that takes channel estimation error due to both noise and one-bit quantization into account. The closed-form expressions, in turn, allow us to obtain insight into important system design issues such as optimal resource allocation, maximal sum spectral efficiency, overall energy efficiency, and number of antennas. Numerical results are presented to verify our analytical results and demonstrate the benefit of optimizing system performance accordingly.},

  abstract = {Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communications refers to the idea equipping cellular base stations (BSs) with a very large number of antennas, and has been shown to potentially allow for orders of magnitude improvement in spectral and energy efficiency using relatively simple (linear) processing. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of state-of-the-art research on the topic, which has recently attracted considerable attention. We begin with an information theoretic analysis to illustrate the conjectured advantages of massive MIMO, and then we address implementation issues related to channel estimation, detection and precoding schemes. We particularly focus on the potential impact of pilot contamination caused by the use of non-orthogonal pilot sequences by users in adjacent cells. We also analyze the energy efficiency achieved by massive MIMO systems, and demonstrate how the degrees of freedom provided by massive MIMO systems enable efficient single-carrier transmission. Finally, the challenges and opportunities associated with implementing massive MIMO in future wireless communications systems are discussed.},

This analysis is of interest in the context of sensor network communication with low cost devices. The key point is that the analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) for such applications should be low-resolution, in order to reduce their cost and power consumption. In this paper, we consider the extreme case of only 1-bit ADC for each receive signal component. We elaborate on some properties of the mutual information compared to the unquantized case. For the SISO case, we show that on-off QPSK signaling is the capacity achieving distribution. To our knowledge, the block-wise Rayleigh-fading channel with mono-bit detection was not studied in the literature.},

Receivers that rely on 1-bit ADC do not need energy-consuming interfaces such as automatic gain control (AGC). This decreases both ADC building and operational costs. Our design is based on maximal ratio combining (MRC), zero-forcing (ZF), and least squares (LS) detection, taking into account the effects of the 1-bit ADC on channel estimation. Through numerical results, we show good performance of the system in terms of mutual information and symbol error rate (SER). Furthermore, we provide an analytical approach to calculate the mutual information and SER of the MRC receiver. The analytical approach reduces complexity in the sense that a symbol and channel noise vectors Monte Carlo simulation is avoided.},
